# Semester 3 | Data Structures & Algorithms

## Final Sprint | Reddit Data Visualization (Bubble Chart)

My goal for this project was to create something I'm passionate about while also gaining experience with client-side data manipulation and visualization.
This project allows a user to enter a subreddit name, and view a bubble chart of relationships to other subreddits via recent poster's user activity.

In the future I may integrate this project into a REST API, but for the current scope of this sprint I decided to focus on client-side only.

To launch, I suggest using [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) for Visual Studio Code.
